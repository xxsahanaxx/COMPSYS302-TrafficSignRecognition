Welcome to our Traffic Sign Recognition project.

To begin, go to the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign and 
download the dataset used in the project. It is a custom dataset with 43 classes in Train folder.
 
Ensure that the dataset is unzipped and main.py exists in the same folder. 

Currently we don't have cli implemented but if you'd like to train one of the 4 models, 
Please change one of the four boolean variables in def main() under main.py.
The 4 boolean variables are
   CNNModel1 = True
   CNNModel2 = False
   CNNModel3 = False
   CNNModel4 = False

You are good to go!
